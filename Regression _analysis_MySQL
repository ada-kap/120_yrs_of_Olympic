Regression Analysis: Height vs Weight

As part of the biometric analysis, I examined whether a linear relationship exists between athlete height and weight using SQL-based approximations of linear regression. 
After filtering out missing values, I calculated the slope and intercept of the best-fit line.

create view widok AS 
select *
from athlete_events ae 
where Height <> 'NA' and Weight <> 'NA'

  with
  average AS 
  (
  SELECT 
    COUNT(*)                 AS n
    ,(AVG(Height)            AS avg_height
    ,(AVG(Weight)            AS avg_weight
    ,(AVG(Height * Weight)   AS avg_hw
    ,(AVG(Height * Height)   AS avg_h2
  FROM widok 
  ),
  stats AS 
  (
  SELECT 
    (AVG(Height*Weight) - AVG(Height) * AVG(Weight)) / 
    (AVG(Height * Height) - POWER(AVG(Height), 2)) AS slope,
    AVG(Weight) - 
    (
    (AVG(Height * Weight) - AVG(Height) * AVG(Weight)) / 
    (AVG(Height * Height) - POWER(AVG(Height), 2))
    ) * AVG(Height) AS intercept
  FROM widok
  )
  SELECT * FROM stats; 

/* result:
      
      Wynik: Weight = -104,4 + 0,99 * Height
      
interpretation: 
      
      This suggests that, on average, for each additional centimeter in height, an athlete's weight increases by approximately 0,99 kilogram. 
The relationship is nearly linear, indicating a strong correlation between body height and weight among Olympic athletes.

This regression was calculated manually in SQL using aggregate functions such as AVG, POWER, and basic formulas for slope and intercept.
Note: The intercept value of -104,4 has no meaningful interpretation in this context, as it represents an extrapolated weight at 0 cm height.
