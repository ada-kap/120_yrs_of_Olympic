🥇🏋️ Journey through data of 120 years of Olympic games

The goal of this project was to analyze data on participants in the Olympic Games from 1896 to 2016 and answer key questions related to female participation, number of athletes, represented countries, sports disciplines, and the relationship between athlete counts and medal achievements. This project is part of my journey to becoming a professional data analyst and is part of my analytics portfolio.

🗃️ Data Source

• The data comes from Sports Reference, shared by Maven Analytics (public domain).

• Each row represents an athlete participating in a specific event, including demographic details, sport discipline, year, host city, type of games, and medal outcome.

🛠️ Tools and Technologies

Excel – used in initial data checks.

MySQL – for querying and analysis.

DBeaver – as the MySQL client.

GitHub – for version control and publishing.

🧠 Analytical Questions asked to the dataset

1. How many athletes have competed in the Olympics?
2. How many countries have participated?
3. How has the percentage of female athletes changed over time?
4. Summer vs Winter Olympics – how do they compare?
5. How many events are there?
6. Which countries send the most athletes?
7. Do countries with the most athletes also win the most medals?

📌 Summary

This project demonstrates how SQL can be used to explore large historical datasets and uncover social and athletic trends. The analysis combines demographic, geographic, and sports-related data to illustrate long-term changes across more than a century.

📈 Future Improvements

• Build an interactive dashboard (e.g., in Power BI.

• Integrate external data (e.g., GDP) to analyze economic impact on medal performance.

• Conduct biometric analysis: relationships between height/weight and specific sports disciplines.
