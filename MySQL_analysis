/* results: 20 Olympics were held during the winter season. More than 17k athletes took part in from 112 different countries.

29 Olympics were held during the summer season. More than 105k athletes took part in from 210 different countries. 
28k were women, and almost 177k were men. The winter season consists of 51 different sports. */

/* insight: The Summer Olympic Games are more popular than the Winter Games mainly because they include more disciplines, 
are more geographically and economically accessible, and have a longer tradition. Winter sports require specific climate conditions 
and infrastructure, which limits the number of participating countries and athletes. As a result, the Summer Olympics attract 
a much broader and more diverse group of athletes from around the world. */
